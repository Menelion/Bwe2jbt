Welcome to the Bwe to Jbt convertor!

This small application converts GwMicro Window-eyes Braille translation tables to FreedomScientific JAWS ones.
You should run it from the command line either from source (if you have Python installed) or by running an executable file.
The application accepts following parameters:
- -h or --help — Displays a short help message. The same happens if no parameter is provided or there are more than 2 parameters.
- Input file — Mandatory parameter: defines a Bwe file to convert from.
- Output file — Optional parameter: defines an output Jbt file. If nothing is given, the file will have the same name as the input one but the .jbt extension.
